Use in moderation and don't make it too blatant or freeflip developers will take moderation action against your account and fix the bug that allows this to be possible.
Have Fun Winning!

Instructions:
Download the .zip
Search chrome://extensions in chrome
Click the button in the top right that toggles developer mode
Click the newly appeared button called load unpacked
Select the .zip and click open
It should be in your extensions menu (the puzzle piece)
Click the puzzle piece and click on the extension
It will open freeflip.gg but next to each coinflip shows who the winner is

Remember to not overuse this as it is suspicious and to occasionally lose small coinflips, this does not work on dice or limbo but we are looking into adding these gamemodes.
